Instead of going to college, Satoshi attended a two-year technical degree program at the Tokyo National College of Technology, where he studied electronics and computer science. 

When Satoshi became a little older he made a special magazine that he would write by hand and staple together called “Game Freak”. Game Freak was a magazine that had tips and tricks on how to beat games and find hidden secrets in them. A hidden secret in a game is called an “Easter Egg”. The magazine became so popular that one magazine sold over 10,000 copies! Satoshi’s friend Ken Sugimori was the person who drew the pictures in the magazine, this is called an illustrator. As the two of them wrote this magazine they realized that most video games weren’t very good. So, they decided to make their own games instead! Tajiri learned how to make games by studying and practicing a lot. Finally, in 1989, Tajiri and his friend Sugimori started their own video game company called Game Freak. Their very first game, Quinty, was a big hit and they never looked back!

After several years of developing games for different consoles,  Satoshi Tajirwhen and his friend Ken Sugimori,  decided to talk about  their idea to Nintendo for a game about collecting monsters. The idea was a hit, but it wasn’t easy to convince Nintendo to take a chance on something so unique. Thanks to their previous successes, Game Freak was given the “OK” to develop the game under the help and mentorship of Shigeru Miyamoto. Shigeru Miyamoto was the creator of Super Mario, a video game about an Italian plumber who crawls through green pipes and collects gold coins while trying to save the princess Daisy from the evil Bowser!
