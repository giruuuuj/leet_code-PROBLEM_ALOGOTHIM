—————————————

Let’s travel back in time to the early 1980s,  in a place called Setagaya, Tokyo, where there was a boy named Satoshi Tajirwhen. Satoshi loved catching bugs and collecting them as a hobby when he was young. His friends even called him “Dr. Bug”!  As Satoshi grew up in the bustling city of Tokyo, he noticed that the spaces where he used to hunt for bugs were disappearing as more and more land was being covered by streets and buildings. But Satoshi didn’t want to lose the feeling of catching and collecting creatures, and he dreamed of a way to bring that same joy to other kids.

As he got older, Satoshi became fascinated with arcade games and spent many hours playing them. His love for games like Space Invaders and Dig Dug inspired him to create his own video games. Satoshi took apart his video game system to understand how it worked, and even won a video game idea contest when he was 16 years old! 

Satoshi’s love for video games never went away even though his parents thought he was a troublemaker for spending so much time playing them. He even cut classes to play games. Ove time he made up for it by attending make-up classes and eventually earning his high school diploma.
